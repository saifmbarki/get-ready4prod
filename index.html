  <h3>Graduate Studies</h3>
  <p>Hi, I am Rachele DiTullio and this is my academic portfolio site for my graduate studies during 2009&#8211;2012. I was a graduate student at the University of Texas at Austin in the <a class="external" href="http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/">School of Information</a>, pursuing a Masters degree in Information Studies. My specific area of focus was information architecture, including related topics such as usability and accessibility of information, particularly for websites, with a special interest in increasing access for deaf users of the Internet. In addition to my studies at <abbr title="University of Texas">UT</abbr> Austin, I started learning Amercian Sign Language (<abbr title="American Sign Language">ASL</abbr>) to aid in my research. I graduated in the spring semester of 2012 with an endorsement of specialization in user experience design. For the latest information about my current skills and projects, please visit my profesional portfolio at <a class="external" href="http://www.racheleditullio.com/">www.racheleditullio.com</a>.</p>
  <h3>Undergraduate Studies</h3>
  <p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in English with a minor in communication. My studies focused on linguistics and writing more than literature. I was a member of the English honors society, Sigma Tau Delta; a founding member of the <abbr title="University of Texas at San Antonio">UTSA</abbr> chapter of the leadership honor society, Omicron Delta Kappa; and a member of the academic honor society, Golden Key. During most of my time at <abbr title="University of Texas at San Antonio">UTSA</abbr>, I was the president and editor of the university yearbook organization, <em>The Chaparral.</em> I also wrote on occasion for the school newspaper, <em>The Paisano</em>.</p>
  <h3>Beyond School</h3>
  <p>I worked full-time as a web developer for a  software company and pursued my <abbr title="Masters of Science in Information Studies">MSIS</abbr> to advance my career as a web professional. When not at work or school, I enjoy traveling, hiking, karaoke, and studying Tae Kwon Do (currently holding the rank of red belt, 2nd gup). I have two cats and am an avid O+ blood donor.</p>
