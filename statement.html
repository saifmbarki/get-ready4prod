   <h2>Statement of Intent</h2>
    <p>In  my cube at work, I have a very prominent sign with a motto by web designer Mark  Wyner that reads 'Visual-design  integrity for people with modern devices and browsers, and information  integrity for everyone  else.'  As a web developer, I think what lies underneath the presentation layer is the  most important part of any web page. While visual design is necessary and increases usability for many users  of information, it cannot and should not supersede a solid informational  foundation. I am a strong proponent of Web  standards, semantic markup, and accessibility for all and I believe that  studying and learning  at the  School   of Information has allowed  me to better understand the ideals of data organization for which I already have a  passion, ultimately making me a better web creator.</p>
    <p>I  thrive on organization, naming conventions, and process, all of which have  helped me in my career as a web developer.&nbsp; I have been very interested in learning   about structuring data to make it optimally usable by both humans and  machines, independent of the delivery method.&nbsp;  I want  to go beyond the page level, beyond markup, and  begin to classify knowledge and make it accessible  to all.&nbsp; I want to create information  hierarchies that are easily understood so that the data can be found and used  anywhere it is needed. My interests have revolved particularly around information architecture and increasing accessibility for deaf users. Whenever possible, I have chosen to pursue research assignments that have furthered my knowledge in these areas.</p>
    <p>Until  recently, I struggled to put a name to this area of study that I see as crucial  for me to become the kind of professional I want to be.&nbsp; When I learned that programs existed for  information architecture, I felt as if I had finally found my  &quot;tribe.&quot;&nbsp; For me, specializing in information  architecture is all about consolidating the wide breadth of knowledge I have around  web development into a single path. I am enjoying the beginnings of my journey down that  path and focusing my learning on the organization of data, usability of that data,  and hope to eventually help form standards and best practices for the field. Much of my coursework has provided a solid foundation in   this field and allowed me to get closer to finding my niche in user interface design and the user's experience  with information retrieval.</p>
    <p>Through my graduate studies, I  have gained an improved understanding of how users interact with information as well as the  systems storing that data and the programs allowing users access to it. Another area that  interests me is  human factors and thus  far in my career, I have had few chances to talk  with users to measure their  success (or frustration) with websites. Eager to learn more about the human factors aspect   when designing and developing systems, I took a course on usability. It gave me a chance to design and conduct my own usability study, allowing me to observe firsthand how people approach using a website. Through these observations, I was able to make well-informed suggestions for improvement based on empirical research, not just my gut feelings about how a site should be designed.</p>
    <p>During  my career, I have made huge, personal strides towards creating more usable websites. In early 2007 I read Jeffrey  Zeldman's book <em>Designing with Web Standards</em>  and it changed my outlook on the building of websites, opening my eyes to a new way of  looking at information access. It was the first tangible explanation I had seen for structuring the data  of web pages separate from the presentation layer. His work introduced me to the pure CSS coding  method and taught me the concept of &quot;semantic markup&quot; which informs my work  today. His book also led me  to start studying accessibility practices and striving to make information  available to all visitors, regardless of browser, device, or disability. I believe earning a  Master of Science in Information Studies will    allow me to  deepen this knowledge and understanding about what makes for good design, and that will  benefit many people.</p>
    <p> Using  the tools I have acquired from studying information architecture at UT Austin, I want  to move beyond being a &quot;code-monkey,&quot; plain and simple. I want to be at the genesis of projects,  helping large organizations, such as government or academic institutions, determine  the best courses of action for managing their data and creating user-friendly  interfaces for retrieval of that data. I want to influence how organizations structure and maintain their information as well as influence the   interface  through usability testing and interviews. I want to get beyond just being the one who  implements designs to being someone who helps create and define those designs  with the user in mind.</p>
    <p>I  view  an  <abbr title="Masters of Science in Information Studies">MSIS</abbr> as a great beginning, one that will provide the tools and foundation that will truly create  a jumping off point for me and my career. I am not only  learning how to organize information in more  intuitive ways or how to better help users interact with information; I am also   gaining  new concepts and  insights as a web professional. I know I have a lot to offer and I believe this degree will open amazing  doors for me,  providing     the knowledge to create   great  designs that are usable, accessible, and have a solid base in information  architecture.</p>
